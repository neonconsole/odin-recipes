    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My grandmother always made this cornbread dressing for holiday dinners and
      for family gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite
      cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in
      this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups crumbled cornbread</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried sage, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch
        baking dish. Place crumbled cornbread in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery
        and sauté until soft, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sautéed onion and celery to the crumbled cornbread. Stir in chicken
        stock, eggs, sage, salt, and pepper until well combined. Pour dressing
        into the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until dressing just starts to turn golden
        brown around the edges, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
