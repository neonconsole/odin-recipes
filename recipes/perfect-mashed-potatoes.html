      <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled and halved lengthwise</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water by about
        1 inch. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer
        until tender and easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain potatoes, then return to the pot. Turn heat to high and allow
        potatoes to dry for about 30 seconds. Turn off heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, then mash in
        milk and butter until smooth and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and black; whisk until evenly distributed, about 15
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
